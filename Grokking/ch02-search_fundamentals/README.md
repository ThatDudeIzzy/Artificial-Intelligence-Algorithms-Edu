# Chapter 2 - Search Fundamentals
## Uninformed Search
Uninformed search is also known as unguided search, blind search, or brute-force search. Uninformed search algorithms have no additional information about the domain of the problem apart from the representation of the problem which is usually a tree.

Think about when you explore things you want to learn. Some might look at a wide breadth of different topics and learn the basics of each, whereas others might choose one narrow topic and explore its subtopics in depth. This is what Breadth-first Search and Depth-first Search involves, respectively. Depth-first search explores a specific path from the start till it finds a goal at the utmost depth. Breadth-first search explores all options at a specific depth before moving to options deeper in the tree.
