## AI Engineering Master Plan

This will be something that will take years to obtain, but will be incredibily difficult without a plan.

Below Will be listed steps, skills to learn, courses to take and degrees to obtain to reach this ultimate goal.

This list will be a living list that will change as the weeks, months, and years pass.

## Complete Introduction to AI

Learn fully what AI is, its impact and future trends.

Learn its appications and its domains.

## Mathematics

Develop a solid foundation in linear algebra and statistics probability

Calculus

## Programming

Become completely fluent in python and C++ at minimum.

## Data Science

Finish Current Data Science Degree

Have solid foundation in Data Analysis and Data Manipulation

## Machine Learning

Read Books Birkenkrahe has given you, including AI algorithms.

Take class on ML, also explore this topic on your own (unsupervised learning)

## Deep Learning

Neuron - Bias - Layers - TensorFlow - Keras (Higher level stuff, years down the line)

## Cloud Services

Azure & AWS

Learn deployment with these services as knowing how to engineer without knowing deployment will be a giant handicap.
