# Chapter 6 - Swarm Intelligence - Ants
Similarly to the theory of evolution, the observation of the behavior of lifeforms in nature is the inspiration for the concepts behind swarm intelligence. When we observe the world around us, we see many different lifeforms that are seemingly primitive and unintelligent as individuals yet exhibit intelligent emergent behavior when acting in groups.

The Ant Colony Optimization algorithm is inspired by the behavior of ants moving between destinations, dropping pheromones and acting on pheromones that they come across. The emergent behavior is ants converging to paths of least resistance.
